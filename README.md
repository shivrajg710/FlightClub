### Project Title: Jack's Flight Club Python Application

#### Project Description

This Python project is inspired by Jack's Flight Club, a service that provides users with alerts about cheapest flights to desired destinations. The application integrates several APIs to offer users a comprehensive flight deal alert system. The core functionalities include searching for flight deals using the Amadeus API, storing and managing user preferences and flight deal data in Google Sheets, and sending personalized email and SMS alerts to users. Below are the detailed components and features of the project:


#### Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Secure user registration and authentication system to manage user accounts and preferences.
   - Options for users to update their preferences and notification settings.

2. **Search and Filter**:
   - Advanced search and filter options for users to customize their flight deal search criteria.
   - Include options such as multi-city searches, flexible dates, and preferred airlines.

3. **Dashboard**:
   - User-friendly dashboard displaying recent flight deals, search history, and personal preferences.
   - Interactive charts and graphs to visualize flight deal trends and insights.

4. **Automated Processes**:
   - Scheduled scripts to automatically fetch flight deals from the Amadeus API and update Google Sheets.
   - Automated email and SMS sending based on the latest flight deals.

#### Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **APIs**: Amadeus API for flight searches, Google Sheets API for data management, and appropriate APIs for sending emails (SMTP) and SMS (Twilio).
- **Database**: Google Sheets (for simplicity and accessibility)

#### Project Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Python application that can search for flight deals, and send personalized alerts via email and SMS. This project will demonstrate how to integrate multiple APIs, manage data efficiently, and provide a user-friendly service that adds real value to its users.
